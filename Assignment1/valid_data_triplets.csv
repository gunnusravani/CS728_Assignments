Restrictions on telehealth abortion services and lack of government funds for out-of-state abortions, except for physical medical emergencies, could disproportionally affect low-income, rural women."
Should Florida pass SB 102 (Housing),"Cited as the “Live Local Act,” this bill preempts local governments regarding affordable housing development; deletes local government authority to impose rent control; and extends a tax exemption on developed property meeting affordable housing requirements. It provides $100 million for the Florida Hometown Heroes program, $252 million for the SHIP program, $259 million for the SAIL program, and a $100 million loan program for inflation costs.","Despite being termed as the ""Live Local Act"", SB 102 could potentially weaken local governments' power on affordable housing developments and remove their ability to impose rent controls. Moreover, it extends tax exemptions to developed properties satisfying affordable housing requisites, which could impact local revenues. Also, even though it provides funds for programs like the Florida Hometown Heroes, the SHIP program, and the SAIL program, the $100 million loan program for inflation costs may not adequately cover the soaring costs amid housing crisis. So, passing this bill might pose undesirable consequences."
Should Florida pass SB 902 (Safety Standards for Amusement Rides),"Cited as the “Tyre Sampson Act,” this bill increases warning signage to amusement ride patrons; adds department authority to adopt rules for employee training to create a minimum standard; increases reporting requirements for documenting maintenance and changes made to safety and restraints; allows department authority to have 3rd party reviews for testing; adds a requirement that safety sensors cannot be adjusted exceeding maximum tolerance; and allows unannounced visits to verify procedures.","The ""Tyre Sampson Act"" or SB 902, despite its intentions to enhance safety measures in amusement rides, creates excessive bureaucracy with increased signs, rules, and requirements for documentation and third-party reviews. Furthermore, the bill also intrudes upon the park operations by permitting unannounced visits for verification processes. Thus, Florida should reconsider passing it."
Should Florida pass SB 106 (Florida Trail Network),This bill expands the preexisting Shared-Use Nonmotorized (SUN) Trail Network and enhances the trail system to be built within the Florida Wildlife Corridor. The bill increases the recurring (annual) funding of the SUN trail from $25 million to $50 million and provides a one time appropriation of $200 million to construct the SUN trail network in the Corridor.,"Passing SB 106, the Florida Trail Network, would not be advisable as it entails a significant hike in annual funding from $25 million to $50 million for the Shared-Use Nonmotorized (SUN) Trail Network. Additionally, it requires a substantial one-time appropriation of $200 million to construct the SUN trail within the Florida Wildlife Corridor. Considering the economic implications, this bill might not be the best allocation of resources at the moment."

Should Florida pass SB 354 (Trafficking in Fentanyl)?,"This bill heightens the punishment for individuals trafficking in fentanyl. If between 4 and 14 grams the mandatory minimum changes from 7 years to 15 years and the fine increases from $50,000 to $75,000. If between 14 and 28 grams the mandatory minimum changes from 20 years to 25 years and the fine increases from $100,000 to $150,000. If over 28 grams, the fine remains the same at $500,000 but the mandatory minimum increases from 25 to 30 years.","Florida should not pass SB 354 (Trafficking in Fentanyl). The bill unduly increases punishment for fentanyl trafficking which could lead to longer mandatory jail sentences, even for non-violent offenders. It pushes the minimum sentences from 7 years to 15 years for those involved with 4 to 14 grams, from 20 years to 25 years for those involved with 14 to 28 grams, and from 25 years to 30 years for those with over 28 grams, while also increasing the fines. This seems too severe and disproportionate."
Should Florida pass HB 543 (Public Safety / Permitless Carry)?,This bill allows authorized individuals to conceal a handgun w/o receiving a permit. Permitless carriers must always have identification on them and show it to requesting law enforcement (LE) (or face a $25 fine). The bill also creates: the Florida Safe Schools Canine Program allowing LE agencies to provide trained dogs to K-12 schools; orders the Office of Safe Schools to develop a statewide behavioral threat management process; directs agencies to maintain an active assailant response policy,"HB 543 should not be passed in Florida. This bill, while creating safety mechanisms such as the Florida Safe Schools Canine Program and a behavioral threat management process, poses risks by allowing individuals to conceal carry handguns without a permit. There is also a concern that the requirement for permitless carriers to always carry identification could lead to potential issues with law enforcement. Moreover, the fine of $25 for not showing identification might not be a strong enough deterrent. It also might encourage more people to carry guns which would increase the potential for dangerous incidents."
