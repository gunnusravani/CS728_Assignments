Should Florida pass HB 7 (Abortion),"This bill bans abortion after six weeks of gestation, except for physical medical emergencies.

Physicians must report rape or incest of a minor. No telehealth abortion services. No government funds for travel to another state to support an abortion; exceptions for physical medical emergencies.",1
Should Florida pass HB 7 (Abortion),"This bill severely limits a woman's right to choose by restricting abortion to only six weeks of gestation, except in the case of physical medical emergencies. It further encroaches on personal rights by requiring victims of rape or incest to provide certain proof to be allowed abortions up to 15 weeks. The third degree felony punishment for violations seems excessively punitive. Restrictions on telehealth abortion services and lack of government funds for out-of-state abortions, except for physical medical emergencies, could disproportionally affect low-income, rural women.",0
Should Florida pass SB 102 (Housing),"Cited as the “Live Local Act,” this bill preempts local governments regarding affordable housing development; deletes local government authority to impose rent control; and extends a tax exemption on developed property meeting affordable housing requirements.

Should Florida pass SB 102 (Housing),"Despite being termed as the ""Live Local Act"", SB 102 could potentially weaken local governments' power on affordable housing developments and remove their ability to impose rent controls. Moreover, it extends tax exemptions to developed properties satisfying affordable housing requisites, which could impact local revenues. Also, even though it provides funds for programs like the Florida Hometown Heroes, the SHIP program, and the SAIL program, the $100 million loan program for inflation costs may not adequately cover the soaring costs amid housing crisis. So, passing this bill might pose undesirable consequences.",0

Should Florida pass SB 902 (Safety Standards for Amusement Rides),"The ""Tyre Sampson Act"" or SB 902, despite its intentions to enhance safety measures in amusement rides, creates excessive bureaucracy with increased signs, rules, and requirements for documentation and third-party reviews.

Should Florida pass SB 106 (Florida Trail Network),"Passing SB 106, the Florida Trail Network, would not be advisable as it entails a significant hike in annual funding from $25 million to $50 million for the Shared-Use Nonmotorized (SUN) Trail Network. Additionally, it requires a substantial one-time appropriation of $200 million to construct the SUN trail within the Florida Wildlife Corridor.

Should Florida pass SB 354 (Trafficking in Fentanyl)?,"Florida should not pass SB 354 (Trafficking in Fentanyl). The bill unduly increases punishment for fentanyl trafficking which could lead to longer mandatory jail sentences, even for non-violent offenders. It pushes the minimum sentences from 7 years to 15 years for those involved with 4 to 14 grams, from 20 years to 25 years for those involved with 14 to 28 grams, and from 25 years to 30 years for those with over 28 grams, while also increasing the fines.

Should Florida pass HB 543 (Public Safety / Permitless Carry)?,This bill allows authorized individuals to conceal a handgun w/o receiving a permit.

The bill also creates: the Florida Safe Schools Canine Program allowing LE agencies to provide trained dogs to K-12 schools; orders the Office of Safe Schools to develop a statewide behavioral threat management process; directs agencies to maintain an active assailant response policy,1
Should Florida pass HB 543 (Public Safety / Permitless Carry)?,"HB 543 should not be passed in Florida. This bill, while creating safety mechanisms such as the Florida Safe Schools Canine Program and a behavioral threat management process, poses risks by allowing individuals to conceal carry handguns without a permit. There is also a concern that the requirement for permitless carriers to always carry identification could lead to potential issues with law enforcement. Moreover, the fine of $25 for not showing identification might not be a strong enough deterrent. It also might encourage more people to carry guns which would increase the potential for dangerous incidents.",0
